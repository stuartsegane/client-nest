# Authentication & User API Security Review

## Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /api/register/` — User registration
- `POST /api/token/` — JWT login (token obtain)
- `POST /api/token/refresh/` — JWT token refresh
- `POST /api/password_reset/` — Password reset request
- `POST /api/reset/<uidb64>/<token>/` — Password reset confirmation

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT authentication is enforced globally (`IsAuthenticated` by default).
- Registration and password reset endpoints allow unauthenticated access as required.

## Password Handling
- Passwords are hashed using Django's built-in mechanisms.
- Password reset uses secure, time-limited tokens.

## Email Security
- Password reset links are sent to the user's registered email.
- In production, a secure SMTP backend should be configured.

## User Model
- Custom user model uses email as the unique identifier.
- Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens) are never exposed in API responses.

## Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
- (Recommended) Add throttling/rate limiting to registration, login, and password reset endpoints.

## Questions for Security Team
- Are there additional password complexity or rotation requirements?
- Should we enforce email verification before allowing login?
- Is multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for any user roles?
- Are there any audit logging requirements for authentication events?
- Any recommendations for securing JWT tokens (e.g., short lifetimes, refresh token rotation)?

## Next Steps
- Please review the implementation and provide feedback or recommendations.
- We are available for a walkthrough or demo if needed.
